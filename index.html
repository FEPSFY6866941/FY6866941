  <p class="ex1">
  The global markets suffered irrefutable change through the recession, triggered by a financial crisis that began in the U.S. housing market and reverberated worldwide. This presentation aims to provide a brief,
  yet informative insight into the recession, understanding the 2008 recession and what led to it, alongside its global impact on economic structures, allowing us to comment on the arising financial policies prior/during 
  the recession. crises. Furthermore, by studying the recession's causes, government responses and paths towards recovery, we can explore the significant reforms in. Findings reveal that economies experienced a slow but 
  resilient recovery, marked by increased financial safeguards and a stronger emphasis on sustainable growth. Concluding with lessons learned, this presentation aims to escalate the importance of ongoing vigilance, 
  flexible economic policies, and changes within financial hierarchy, to ensure this doesn’t occur again.

 <p class="ex1">
 The 2008 recession refers to the period between 2007-2009, by which a multitude of factors had assisted in weakening global financial systems. Leading up to the crisis, there were many telltale signs that should have set 
 off alarm bells. (Sher Verick, Iyantul Islam, 2010). Most significantly, was the growth of subprime mortgages, which were high-risk loans provided to borrowers with poor credit histories. This led to instability, as many 
 institutions were taking risks lending to individuals, with a chance of repayment, that resulted in banking failures, as banks fail to survive under the pressure of piling bankrupt debts. This subsequent financial instability
 surrounding individuals all the way up to corporate firms, resulted in a case where the unemployment rate doubled from 4.5 percent in November 2007 to a peak of 10.6 percent in January 2010 (Seefeldt, Kristin S.; Graham,
 John D, 2013).  Due to the emergence of unemployment, alongside declining housing prices, the economy lost a net total of over 4.3 million jobs in 2008 and 2009 (Grusky et al., 2011). Meanwhile, A combination of a fall in
 housing wealth from declining house prices and a fall in real income from increasing energy and food prices made individuals worse off (Hetzel, Robert L, 2009).  This resulted in a state where individuals were left to 
 suffer as it should have been clear that an increase in interest rates would make it impossible for many borrowers to service their debt (J Stiglitz, 2009).  A clear display of ignorance amongst many things, which had led
 to a crisis, that is still impacting today’s global economy.  Therefore, the Federal Reserve were under the mindset that incurring economic growth would be possible through making credit easier to access. This, however 
 resulted in ‘The US Housing Boom of 2001-06 and the subsequent bust’, where ‘Overly expansionary monetary policy fuelled imprudent lending’, (Beckworth, David M, 2012), meaning an influx in borrowing resulted in lower supply
 causing such bust, diminishing loans and household value. Thus, we can see how through the lack of foresight within the American Financial Sector, a recession had become inevitable.

 The impact of the 2008 recession had reached far beyond the US. Firstly, within the US, we see the first major event occurring because of the recession, where on 15 September 2008 Lehman Brothers defaulted in the world’s 
 largest-ever bankruptcy (Congdon, Tim, 2014). The Lehman Brothers – a financial services firm, influential due to its market power within housing, were key in highlighting the negatives in line with subprime mortgages, 
 relying on short-term borrowing, which would be detrimental within the long term, as this would force investors to pull out due to the failure for individuals to repay debts, resulting in vulnerability as its assets 
 dropped, forcing them to bankruptcy. This exemplified the risks firms faced, due to the lack of foresight that resulted in failure. Therefore, this served as a spearhead for the dangers both financially and foundationally 
 firms faced within the recession and after, as they sought to recover.  Furthermore, the loss of jobs for the 50 states totaled 8,744,900 between December of 2007 and the end of 2009 (Connaughton & Madsen, 2012). This 
 indicates the mass waves of unemployment within the US, but similarly mirrored globally with unemployment in many countries/industries. As a result, the recession had left millions below the poverty line, widening 
 disparity between the working class and the wealthy, who were able to recover easier. Therefore, as average GDP dropped due to the recession, this left countries, reliant on exporting goods such as China/Japan, with a dip
 within GDP, as demand dropped. Similarly, we saw the impact on countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, (BRIC) as a lot of US investors withdrew huge amount of money from BRICs stock market, which made the 
 shrinkage of stock market index in each of BRICs country. (FATMA, S.F. ,2013). This led to decline in investors and stunted economic growth for the years to come. Likewise, across the globe, in its latest update of 
 January 28, 2009, the IMF predicts that, as a direct consequence of the global financial crisis, Africa’s growth will drop to a low rate of 3.4 percent in 2009 (ZULU, P., 2011). Finally, we can see the 
 physical/socioeconomic aspect as the great recession had wide-ranging impacts on health including poorer self-rated health and increased cardiovascular and respiratory disease (Jenkins et al., 2021).

<p class="ex1">
 The post-recession climate had begun within the US, facing challenges such as budget deficits, with numbers just released showing that the fiscal 2009 deficit reached $1.4 trillion, or about 10 percent of GDP 
 (Romer, C.D, 2009). As we enter the tail end of the recession, there was a consensus that employment would require years of recovery. In its November 2010 follow-up wave of surveys with individuals who were unemployed 
 at some time between September 2008 – August 2009, nearly 90% of respondents felt that unemployment would not return to its levels before the recession began until “many years” had passed or that it would never do so 
 (Godofsky et al., 2010). Then, we can see that although it would take a while to recover, a slow and steady recovery followed the Great Recession’s official end in the summer of 2009, but because it was slow and the 
 recession was so deep, it took years to reduce slack in labour markets. Accordingly, the economic expansion following the Great Recession included the longest streak of job growth on record. Beginning in October 2010, 
 the economy added jobs for 113 consecutive months. The streak ended in March 2020 when the COVID-19 recession began. (Jay C. Shambaugh, Michael R. Strain,2021). This ultimately, highlighted the ongoing growth post-2008, 
 up until the modern day, providing hope for the future and assisting in minimising the deficits uprising from the recession.
